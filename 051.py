"""I started solving this problem hard way â€“ for prime chceck its family
I got result in 70 seconds but according to Project euler i should be able to
solve it under minute. I started to look at divisibility by 3. It can be shown that
our family must have at least 3 changing digits.
Also it can be shown that 4 digit is too much.
Looks like we need to check numbers that have 3k same digits and since we want smallest family
we can start with just 3 digits."""
